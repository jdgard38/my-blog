# _College Football Home Field Advantage_
College football is what makes fall a great time of year. I love Saturdays during the fall being able to sit and watch games all day. I set out to explore college football data to gain insights into game statistics, team performance, and player contributions. College football is a popular sport with a rich history and a passionate fan base, making it an interesting and relevant topic for data analysis. By curating and analyzing this dataset, I aim to uncover patterns and trends that can provide a deeper understanding of the game.

# _My Interest_
I am interested in finding out how the home field advantage affects the scoring of a home team, so I will be looking at the total points the home teams score in there games.

## _My Data_
I configured a data frame that shows what conference a team is in, how many points they scored, if the game was a conference game, and a few other things. 
To do this I used the following steps:
- Obtained an API key from the College Football Data website.
- The website allows students to scrape their data up to 1,000 times per month. 
- Used Python's requests library to make API calls and retrieve data on games, teams, and player statistics.
- Processed the raw data to remove unnecessary columns and rows, handle missing values, and ensure consistency.
- Combined data from multiple endpoints to create a comprehensive dataset for analysis.
Here is the code I used to do this:
```python
import requests
import pandas as pd

# Your API key
api_key = 'your_api_key'

# Base URL of the API
base_url = 'https://api.collegefootballdata.com/'

# Headers including the API key
headers = {
    'Authorization': f'Bearer {api_key}'
}

# Get games data
games_params = {'year': 2022, 'seasonType': 'regular'}
games_df = get_data('games', games_params)

# Get teams data
teams_df = get_data('teams')

merged_df = pd.merge(games_df, teams_df, left_on='home_id', right_on='id', suffixes=('_game', '_team'))

# Drop the columns that im not interested in
columns_to_drop = ['home_line_scores', 'home_pregame_elo', 'home_postgame_elo',
       'away_id', 'away_team', 'away_conference', 'away_division',
       'away_points', 'away_line_scores', 'away_post_win_prob','home_id',
       'away_pregame_elo', 'away_postgame_elo', 'excitement_index',
       'highlights', 'notes', 'id_team', 'school', 'mascot', 'abbreviation',
       'alt_name1', 'alt_name2', 'alt_name3', 'conference', 'classification', 'completed',
       'neutral_site', 'start_time_tbd', 'start_date', 'home_post_win_prob',
       'color', 'alt_color', 'logos', 'twitter', 'location','attendance','id_game','venue_id','season_type','venue','venue_id']

cleaned_df = merged_df.drop(columns=columns_to_drop)
print(cleaned_df.head)
# Get rid of the excess rows that I don't need
indices_to_drop = list(range(201, 3649))
cleaned_df = cleaned_df.drop(index=indices_to_drop)
print(cleaned_df.head)

# Save to a csv file
cleaned_df.to_csv('post2data.csv', index = False)
```
# EDA Highlights
I wanted to see the mean of the home team points. I also graphed the different scores by frequency so I can visually see the scores that happen the most. 
- The mean home team score was 30.08910891089109.
- The variance is 257.5741096497709
- The mean of week 1 was 29.965174 compared to the mean of week 15 55.0000

# Conclusion
- The home team scores more points than the away team according to this data.
- The home team gets better as the season goes on and scores more at home the deeper in the season. 
- The reason for the higher scores later in the season is not clear, but the data points to the opponents defenses being weaker or more figured out. 
- From an outside perspective, teams get to know their playbook better as the year goes on and chemistry between offensive skills players increases as well. There is not a numerical way to track this data, however we can make these assumptions and hope to find data that can back this.
